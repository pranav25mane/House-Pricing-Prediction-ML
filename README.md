# House-Pricing-Prediction-ML




House Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. It follows a complete end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Key Steps

Data Loading: Imported training and testing datasets.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values (mode for categorical, mean for numerical).

Feature Engineering: Applied Label Encoding for categorical data and Standard Scaling for continuous data.

Modeling: Built prediction models using Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.

Model Training: Split data into training and testing sets.

Evaluation: Assessed model performance with RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.

Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, GridSearchCV)

Matplotlib for visualization
